# tinkoff_ml_life
Entry task(mini life simulation) for tinkoff ml course

## Usage  
`python main.py -h` or `python main.py --help` for getting help on usage.  
`python main.py -probas x y z w -size n` - run with probability of appearing empty cell to x, 
fish cell to y, shrimp cell to z and rock cell to w, size of field equal to n and default seed equl to 200(idk why ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯).  
To add custom seed, use flag -seed SEED.
